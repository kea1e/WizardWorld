# 🪄 WizardWorld

Welcome, apprentice. You have entered WizardWorld — a cozy grimoire of code where curious spells (scripts), charming demos, and creative experiments live. This README is intentionally wizerdy: short, stylish, and helpful. Tweak it, conjure new sections, or ask me to tailor it to the project's actual stack and entrypoint.

## ✨ What is WizardWorld?

WizardWorld is a playful collection of code artifacts — think demos, utilities, and experiments — gathered like charms in a spellbook. It’s meant to be forked, remixed, and expanded. Whether this folder powers a game, a small library, or a whimsical demo, treat it as a starting point for magical tinkering.

If you want this README aligned to the repo’s exact purpose (web app, CLI, Python package, Node project, etc.), tell me the primary language and entrypoint and I’ll update with specific commands and badges.

---

## 🧭 Quickstart — Summon the project

Clone the repo and open the grimoire:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kea1e/WizardWorld.git
cd WizardWorld/wizardworld
```

Common example run commands (pick the one that matches your stack):

```bash
# If Python
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py

# If Node
npm install
npm start

# If static demo
# open wizardworld/index.html in your browser
```

Tell me which of the above is the real workflow and I’ll replace these guesses with precise commands.

## 🔮 Features & Vibes

- Playful, exploratory code — ideal for learning and prototyping
- Small, composable scripts (spells) designed to be easy to understand
- Example usages and toy demos to inspire remixing
- Easy to fork and extend — bring your own incantations

---

## 🧾 Spellbook — Useful commands

- Inspect files:
  - ls, tree, or open the folder in your editor
- Run tests (if present):
  - pytest or npm test
- Format code (if configured):
  - black . or npm run format
- Run a script:
  - python scripts/summon.py or node scripts/summon.js

If you want, I can add a Makefile or npm scripts to centralize these commands.

---

## 🤝 Contributing — Add your incantations

Contributions are welcome! A simple path:

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a branch with a magical name (e.g., feat/summon-fireball).
3. Add your changes and, if applicable, small tests or examples.
4. Open a PR describing the spell you added and why.

Small, focused changes are easiest to review. If you want, I can generate ISSUE and PULL REQUEST templates for the repo.

---

## 🧵 Style & Practices

- Keep spells (functions) focused and well-named.
- Document tricky rituals with short examples and comments.
- Favor readability over cleverness — clarity is a powerful charm.

---

## 🧩 Project Roadmap (optional)

- Add CI (tests + lint)
- Add badges (build, coverage, license)
- Expand example spells and demos
- Create a stable API for commonly used utilities

Tell me which items you want prioritized and I’ll draft issues for the roadmap.

---

## 📜 License

No license file detected here (yet). MIT is a friendly default if you want broad reuse. Tell me which license you prefer and I’ll add a LICENSE file.

If you’d like, I can:
- Tailor this README to the exact language/framework in this folder,
- Add badges and a short demo GIF,
- Create ISSUE and PR templates,
- Or prepare a LICENSE and CONTRIBUTING.md.

Say the word and I’ll enchant the README further.
